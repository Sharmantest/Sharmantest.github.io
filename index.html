              <p> 
              Take it from Mr.13.5K to be exact, your videos have improved so much over such a short period of time. 
              I'm happy you're doing this, you look like you're having a lot of fun. It's also fun to watch your videos
              (well the ones I watch at least- WHICH IS ALL OF THEM I PROMISE). You've come a long way, we know your work 
              ethic is insane, you just have to put in the hours and play it smart(business wise) and you'll go a long way. 
              I expect to see you as the go to book-reviewer one day. You'll get there, I know it.

              <p> 
                Like I said in the last section, you have the work ethic, just be sure to play it smart. You can grind hours on 
                Youtube for it to not go as far as it could. I would personally go on TikTok and dedicate an account to just small 
                snippets/clips of your reviews/videos. That way you're getting twice the output for the same amount of work. 
                Then have it all funnel back to your YouTube.

                Have fun and enjoy it, like you alrerady are. You'll be there eventually, and wherever we both may be in the future
                you can guarantee for sure I'll be watching and supporting your videos. Just be sure to not forget your number 1 fan. 
                I'm glad I get to be there and watch you grow, hopefully you've been inspired from my greatness as well.
                You're a wonderful person, and exceptional in so many ways, please don't ever forget that, you enjoy all the 
                happiness in the world. If you're ever lost or need a shoulder to lean on, I'll always be one phone call away. 
                Happy 25th, I'll always love you, and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for you.

               Working hard is important. But there's something that matters even more, believing in yourself.

                Think of it this way; every great wizard in history has started out as nothing more than what we are now, students. If they can do it, why not us?
